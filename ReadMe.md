A Flag of Earth, inspired by James W. Cadle's Flag of Earth, with additional detailing.

## Inspiration

1) The sun was broadened by shading it in in five different colors representing the core, the radiative and convective zones, and the photo- and chromosphere respectively.

2) Earth was extended by its surface composition, which are represented as concentrical rings, with each ring representing a type of surface and having the equal relative surface area of that type of surface's share of Earth's surface. From the outer ring to the inner circle, the rings respectivels represent: Deep ocean trenches (1.18%); the ocean floor (56.92%); the oceans' transitional zones (8.05%); the continental shelf (5.00%); deserts, sand, coastal and urban areas (3.34%); agricultural areas (10.01%); shrubs (2.36%); forests and jungles (7.65%); rocky and mountaineous areas (2.55%); and icy, snowy and glacial areas (2.94%).

3) The moon follows a similar concentric ring scheme as Earth, with its surface comprising of lunar highlands (83%) and marias (17%). Furthermore, the moon's position was mirrored vertically.


## Results

1) An [SVG](https://github.com/ariebesehl/FlagOfEarth/raw/main/flag-earth-cr4qsh0t.svg) of the flag

2) PNGs of the flag [4640x2880](https://github.com/ariebesehl/FlagOfEarth/raw/main/flag-earth-cr4qsh0t-4640.png), [2320x1440](https://github.com/ariebesehl/FlagOfEarth/raw/main/flag-earth-cr4qsh0t-2320.png), [1160x720](https://github.com/ariebesehl/FlagOfEarth/raw/main/flag-earth-cr4qsh0t-1160.png), [580x360](https://github.com/ariebesehl/FlagOfEarth/raw/main/flag-earth-cr4qsh0t-580.png)


## Method

1) Execute `script.py` to generate an SVG in its folder of execution


## Tools

1) Python, for generating the flag as an SVG file

2) GIMP, for rendering PNGs from the SVG


## Motivation

For a web application I'm working on, I needed a Flag of Earth. I entered "Earth" as `$COUNTRY` into my Python script for downloading flag SVGs off of the Wikimedia Commons, and was quite surprised to see it didn't `404`. I was also equally surprised by the downloaded flag itself, especially about its inclusion of the sun and the moon, which, more often than not, go ignored on other, rather earth-centric, flag representations of Earth. However, I did soon find the flag somewhat rather lackluster in details, and thought about ways of improving it.
